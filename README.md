# Task Tracker!

Have a look at the latest version [hosted on Netlify](https://gtasktracker.netlify.app/).
The client-side queries and mutates data from my server-side/database hosted on Heroku. [Link to code on Github].
This readme is a work in progress. Proper links and screenshots are on the way.

## How I worked on this project

My primary goal was to demonstrate skills required to succeed in a professional work environment.

- I built this app based wireframes and feedback from potential users.
- I used my own Task Tracker as I was building it, drawing inspiration from Kanban boards: [Screenshot of tasks]
- I aimed to improve my use of version control and develop a system for consistent commit messaging.

## How to navigate this project

- Somewhat complex stateful logic: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- Responsive CSS using styled-components: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- The application queries and mutates data from a custom MongoDB database that I built, maintain and host on Heroku: [link to code on GitHub].

## Why I built the project this way

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app, using `useState` is
  sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or
  react-query are often used for data management.
- Semantic UI React is a great library that offers lightly styled React Components. It is JQuery free, declarative, and highly customizable.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer. But for this project I chose to focus on the
  backend. I decided to use MongoDB, Apollo, and GraphQl to create a custom server hosted on Heroku. I also
  enjoy working on the frontend!
- I've learned that testing is an essential part of production applications.

## As I continue to work on this I intend to...

- Add unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Set up continuous integration to run tests and ESLint on every Pull Request.
- Refactor some of the code. [link to code on GitHub]
